# pwrShl_fncts
A grouping of different powershell scripts and functions that each aim to provide a poweruser experience and easier automation for the layman. 
Each script/fork is a different system administration task in powershell. As well, I am just now learning to use git, so things will be messy at first, please bare with me.
